Been working on Enso intermittently for 10 years, trying to develop a
new style of programming. Our typical approach is to gather
requirements, write code, and inspect the behavior of the code. But
there's also this other thing going on: the programmer is figuring out
what strategy they should use to solve the problem. That strategy
becomes a pervasive part of the programmer's mindset, and influences
all of the code they write.
